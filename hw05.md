1 Give the three representations of an AND gate
and say in yourwords what AND means.
 串联电路，且。
2) Give the three representations of an XOR gate
and say in yourwords what XOR means.
  输入相同时结果为0，不同时结果为1。
3) Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to 
the following Booleanexpression: (A + B)(B + C)

4) Show the behavior of the following circuit
    ith a truth table:
5) What is circuit equivalence? Use truth
 table to prove thefollowing formula.
  (AB)’ = A’ + B’

7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. 
 Such as
(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2 = (0000X4X3X2X1)2
We called that (00001111)2
is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work.
Fill the follow expression
(1) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (x8x7x6x51111 )2
(2) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2xor (00001111)2 = ( x8x7x6x51111)2
(3) ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (11110000)2)or(not(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2and (00001111)2) = (x8x7x6x51111 )

   1)Logic gate    
     is an idealized or physical device
     implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs
     a logical operation on one or more binary inputs 
      and produces a single binary output. 
     2)Boolean algebra
       is the branch of algebra in which the
       values of the variables are the truth values
       true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively.
